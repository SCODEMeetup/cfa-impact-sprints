## Description

The purpose of this repo is to store the issues and documentation associated with the OpenColumbus project participating in the Code For America Impact Sprints Program.  The OpenColumbus project is an opportunity to:

- Accelerate completion of OpenColumbusâ€™ OpenSidwalk project in the North Linden neighborhood. 
- Initiate Open Sidewalk mapping projects of areas in Columbus adjacent to LinkUS corridors.
- Improve first and last mile mobility for pedestrians in North Linden and along LinkUS corridors with the AccessMap web app.
- Provide data analysis for completeness of pedestrian safety and accessibility gaps.

The Impact Sprints is roughly a 3 month period of 1 month sprints from July-September of 2022.  It includes reaching out to accessibility and safety stakeholders and partners including the Mid Ohio Regional Planning Commission for input to make the greatest impact.  

It also includes ramping up mapping, data analysis volunteers to scale up this effort as well as volunteers for further efforts (some beyond the scope of this project) to help create graphical representations and a web application for cross referencing ancillary data, e.g., crash data, bus stops, water resources, etc.

The long term Impact we are hoping to have is:

- Improved Pedestrian accessibility and safety.
- Improved quality of life in areas of workforce participation and access to housing, food, and transportation.
